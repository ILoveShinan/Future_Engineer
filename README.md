We read the Chinese rules and discussed the length and width limitations of the organisation.We began to discuss the sensors and design and manufacture of the organisation, how to use only one DC motor and how to make the steering structure.

We installed L298n DC Controller GA25-371 DC Controller because there was no direct GA25-371 DC Controller for our use.Since L298n DC Madonna Control Board needs to be connected to external sources, we manufacture an electric line for Legato3S off-leave polymer line for Legato298n DC Madonna Control Board.

After the actual test, we found that the battery could easily come off the vehicle. To solve this problem, we installed Devil's Stain on the vehicle and the battery so that it could be more effectively attached to the vehicle.Based on actual measurements, this method is indeed feasible.

We're going to plan an ultrasound sensor on a car, use it to leave somewhere, know if it needs to be, and then it's going to flip over because of its position, so we're going to flip it early and late, so we're going to multi-position it.

In order to keep the model in a straight line, we have found that the error in the values of the model in a specific area can be too large for the model to walk in a straight line. Attaching the model to a height can improve the accuracy of the model.

Although the EDT sensor has been installed in a higher position, sometimes the error value is still a bit large in the field. When we encounter this problem, we think that we can reduce the error value of the EDT in the field by using EDT correction.

Today, we install the Pixy2 image recognition module on the vehicle and the vehicle can read the information of the Pixy2 image recognition module successfully. After the vehicle has read the Pixy2 image recognition module steadily, we write a program to identify and dodge blocks.

Today, we use Pixy2 image recognition team to recognize the color of blocks and dodge blocks. In order to distinguish the distance from the distance, we use Y coordinates to judge the distance from the near blocks.

We made LED lamp module and installed it in the rear of the organization. Since Pixy2 video recognition module cannot display the image recognition results immediately, we used homemade LED lamp module to indicate the result detected by Pixy2 video recognition module.

To test whether the Lego motor is faster than the original drive motor and the steering is better than the servo motor, we have made a car out of Lego today. The base of the Lego vehicle follows the original vehicle design.

Today we're going to put the Pixie2 image identification group on EV3 and EV3 will be able to get information from the Pixie2 image identification group, establishing that EV3 can fit with the Pixie2 image identification group, and EV3 can avoid congestion.

After the test we find although the camera installed on the EV3 can correctly recognize the color and coordinates of traffic signs and dodge traffic signs all right but can not installed how many traffic sign which can not achieve the effect we need so in the end we gave up the Lego vehicle.

On actual testing, we found that although the Pixy2 image recognition module could accurately identify the colour and coordinates of the blocks on the EV3 and dodge the blocks, it could not detect the number of blocks on the screen.We decided to give up the Lego because we couldn't get the results we needed.

After the test, we found that the Pixy2 image recognition module was exposed when installing the wide-angle mirror, so we took the wide-angle mirror, but the next traffic sign could not be detected.

In order for us to detect the next object, maybe we'll decide on the mirror and jump to the specified angle so that the pixy2 image can be detected.

Since we practice constantly until the battery is dead and slow down, we attach a low voltage alarm to the battery to find out how much the battery is charged. When the battery is dead, a low voltage alarm will sound an alarm to inform you that the battery is dead.

Today we started writing a three-turn program that uses ultrasound to detect when the vehicle is about to turn and to keep the vehicle in a straight line. These two sensors are used to drive the vehicle three times, but the program does not recognize the traffic signs.

Today we are going to run the three-turn program to add the traffic sign recognition program, but this program needs to turn the vehicle to the middle of the course. If it does not reach the middle of the course, it will make a bad decision.
