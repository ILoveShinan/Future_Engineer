## Funtion：
- It is made of light－emitting diodes, resistors and dot matrix boards.

- Use Matrix MINI controller digital pin output to control the LED light on and off.

## Application：
- Since the Pixy2 image recognition module cannot display the image recognition results in real time, a self-made LED light module is used to indicate the results of the Pixy2 image recognition with lights.
